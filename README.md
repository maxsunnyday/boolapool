### Description
Are you a student with places to go? Do you fancy an uber or lyft but not the fares? Well have we got a web app for you!
Welcome to BoolaPool, a social app that connects a variety of students with common destinations.

Picture it: At the end of the semester when students are leaving en masse to the airports. Many take a combination of shuttles, buses, and trains, but the easiest mode of transportation will always be a rideshare. The only problem is they are not so easy on the wallet, especially on a student budget. BoolaPool helps connect students who are going to the same place so that they can save money and save the environment! 

For example, an uber to Bradley International Airport could cost upwards of $60 when traveling solo. Split it with one of your new friends you'll make on BoolaPool and you've already saved $30 after your first use!

BoolaPool also hopes to serve as Yale's dedicated platform for coordinating carpools. This will take away the awkwardness of asking unknown classmates to carpool, and will save students the time and energy spent looking for carpoolees on facebook groups.

### Features
So what can you do with BoolaPool?
##### Search
BoolaPool will allow you to specify where you want to go and pull up all matching trips from our database that have been made by other users, making sure to exclude trips that have already passed their departure window.

##### Join Trips
If you find a trip you would like to be a part of, you can join it with the click of a button and BoolaPool will send all members of that trip notifications with your contact information so they can reach you.

##### Create Trips
If the trip you want to go on doesn't exist yet, you can make it yourself! Specifying the details of your trip can be done with a quick and easy form and will be displayed to all other users on the site. You will also get notifications when other people join your trip!
